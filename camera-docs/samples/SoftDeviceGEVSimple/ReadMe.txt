2. Prerequisites

This sample assumes that:
 * You have a network adapter installed on your PC with a valid IP address.
 * You have a GigE Vision controller/receiver that can receive and display images (such as eBUSPlayer or any other GigE Vision receiver that supports the GVSP protocol). The receiver should be reachable and on the same subnet as the interface from which it will be receiving.
 * You have an eBUS Edge Runtime License installed on your system

Sample code as described above. Please refer to the comments in the source code for information on the methods used in this sample.


IMPORTANT: If you do not have a Pleora eBUS SDK Seat License for eBUS SDK or an eBUS Edge Runtime License installed on your system,
it will restrict your ability to customize the identity of the device and will disconnect all applications after 15 minutes.
